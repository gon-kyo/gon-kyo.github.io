		Hello, and welcome. I am Gonkyo. I'm an aspiring computer engineer and developer. Everything for the site is made by me and without
		the help of a web design company or their assets. Because of this, I ask that whoever is reading please be patient with any updates
		or bug fixes that need to be done here. I'll get to it eventually. <br>
		With that out of the way, thank you for stopping by. I welcome you to take a little dive into the aspects of myself I share with the
		anonymity the internet. Some of the worst, and maybe some of the best parts of me will be here. Indulge whatever corner of your psyche
		this place scratches, but be warned. The parts of me reflected here may be within you as well. <br>
		I carved out this small corner of the internet for myself to seal a piece of myself in the time capsule that is the internet, and 
		serve as proof to job interviewers that I know how to do web development. Hopefully what is here is promising enough to get a job 
		in the future. <br>
		Without further adieu, enjoy!
