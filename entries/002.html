	<p1> 02 Where do we Derive Value
	</p1>
	<div class="textStorage">
	<p>
	Value is something hard for us to define. For some, it's intrinsically tied to money and the price of things. For others, it is some vague ideal that is indescribable and 
	based on nothing but the mere whims of whoever procures a thing. The second idea especially feels unhelpful because if value is some completely arbitrary thing, why is it 
	useful to define a value for things in the first place if the concept is inherently metaphysical. Likewise, if we derive value directly from the price of something, that
	seems in many cases just as incoherent. We live in the age of art pieces being sold for millions despite being nothing more than abstract shapes on canvas produced by someone
	famous. There are now entire digital currencies that are a sum of memory and used processing power, only worth however much a community is willing to believe they are worth.
	If we really want to split hairs, there isn't much difference between bit-coin and paper based, fiat currencies. There's nothing overtly that this paper money is based on,
	and bodies of people can fluctuate prices greatly by printing or burning currency at their leisure. This is why I think value has to come from somewhere else. 
	Value is at the crossroads of work, time, and need. Need as a concept is very simple for us to understand. Lots of things have intrinsic value despite low prices, abundance,
	or easy access because we need them to live and sustain ourselves. Water, food, and shelter come to mind immediately, and so the less essential something is to survival, the 
	less value it can derive from need. <br>
	For me, work and time are intrinsically related. In the most strict definitions of physics, total work done is the amount of energy required to exert a force over some distance.
	In this line of reasoning, I'm going to allow myself a little more freedom, but get my definition from a similar place. For now, work is the amount of energy a person expended
	doing a thing or making an item. Likewise, when we determine the time needed to do that work, in physics that becomes power. I don't think it should be any different
	here either. Value can't be determined without this sort of human-power of production. Total value of any given thing then, is the sum of need and human-power needed to produced
	it, as well as the value of any component parts. Now, parts of this may seem blatantly obvious, why would I be saying this like a rube instead of talking to real people like an
	absolute chad? Well I may be an idiot but I'm not stupid. These little consistencies are important to hammer out because if they hold true, they have implications about price,
	society, technology, and a lot of other things that impact our lives more than we realize. <br>
	More to follow.
