all the national center does is change from probationary to full.

any pledge to the organization national or international will go to fighting fund pledges
fighting fund pledges roll over to the next year

Journal tab deals with personal branch finances
don't leave categories blank

with categories you can track sale of individual SR's 
most of them have to do with sales
then there are operational expenses 
Local FF stays in the branch
for imt ff, first have it come in as local fighting fund,
then send it as an expense to the imt ff. This is for money being sent to the national or international that we've
raised
all i have to do with press journal is copy the report, paste it, add the month, call it a day
columns e through g rows 4-7 to copy, go to journal, 
click on an empty space in category, and paste values only

There will be a handoff of press money at the end of the month between 
press officer and finance officer
Don't send money outside of sending the report

The national center keeps track of reciepts from venmo

cc member will submit people for full membership 

it is my responsibility to report members for recruit or removal. That form is at the bottom of
imt bulletins. Name changes transfers, and email changes can be taken care of through this link

Dues increases can be taken care of on the spreadsheet, and a note left in the report
if anyone is behind let the bc know and other officers know
once it becomes a large number of months of missed dues, tell the national center what's going on, even if I 
don't really know include this in the report

for people getting behind on dues, once you hit 4 months without dues you are a probationary member in the constitution
after 6 months you are no longer considered a member of the organization
extenuating cases can be considered mostly due to sustained communication

finances isn't necesarily always telling, but when you look at the finances you see the state of a branch
and its leadership
